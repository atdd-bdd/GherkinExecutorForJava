Designing with Abstractions / Domain Driven Design 

 **Value Objects**: are small, immutable objects that describe aspects of the domain. They **don’t have an identity**—they’re defined entirely by their attributes. Think of things like `Money`, `Date`. If two value objects have the same values, they’re considered equal

.* **Entities**:     These are domain objects that **do have a unique identity** that persists over time, even if their attributes change. For example, a `Customer` or `Order` would be an entity.

* **Aggregates**: These are **clusters of entities and value objects** that are treated as a single unit. Each aggregate has a **root entity** (called the Aggregate Root), and all access to the aggregate goes through this root. For example, an `Order` aggregate might contain `OrderLine` entities and `Money` value objects.

Now let's take a more detailed look at Value Objects.   They have a name (e.g. Money or Money), which could be the name of a class or an enumeration (e.g. DayOfTheWeek).   They have a primitive attribute (int, string, double, enum, etc.) which contains the value.   The primitive is typically encapsulated (not exposed to the outside world).   .  

Let's add one additional aspect that Value Objects could have - a textual representation (regardless of the language primitive in which they are represented)

Now how do you represent these in a featurex file (an extended feature file)





Here's how you can describe a value object - by specifying valid values.
