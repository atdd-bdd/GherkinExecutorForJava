To Do and Miscellaneous Notes 



## Benefits

- Works with existing Xunit frameworks.   A Scenario is one XUnit test. 

- Little configuration - Where are the feature files (default is JetBrains) and where to put the test

- Adaptable - redo Translate to your liking,  could get feature files from elsewhere, could translate and execute feature files in a single step, etc.  

- Source code is all there

- Separates logical tests from implementation in code 

- Promotes writing tests.  Tabular notes on a blackboard can easily convert into a test.  

- Promotes DDD.  Domain types show up in the feature file. 

- Developers can create the feature file in lieu of a parameterized unit test.  Sometimes it's easier to scan a table to see missing conditions.   

### Disadvantages

-  Have to run Translate after changing feature file.   Could incorporate this into IDE 

- 

It is easier to translate data to what is required than it is to duplicate logic
